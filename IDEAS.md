Ideas for the overlay
=====================

Soon (tm)
---------
- Toggle overlay visibility
- Multiple position profiles support (i.e. per-game? Perhaps detect game executable and switch?)
- Adjust overlay height (need to scale transform here?)
- Interact with the overlay (scrolling, clicking, etc...

Future
------
- Desktop/window capture (Wayland too?)
